 * Measurement frame, 22 bytes, notified on FFF1.
 *
 *   [0-1]   a5 02        protocol marker
 *   [2]     sequence, increments once per frame and wraps
 *   [3-4]   10 00        payload length, 16
 *   [5]     checksum
 *   [6-9]   01 61 a1 00  fixed, part of the frame signature
 *   [10-12] weight, 24-bit LITTLE-endian, in grams
 *   [13-14] impedance, uint16 LE, ohms
 *   [19]    1 once the scale has settled; 0 for every frame before that
 *   [20]    1 when the impedance field is populated
 *   [21]    display unit: 0 kg, 1 lb, 2 st
 *
 * The weight is grams regardless of what the scale is displaying, so
 * `normalizesWeight` holds and the display unit is only logged.
 *
 * Decoded from the debug log in #385 (Etekcity Smart Fitness Scale,
 * D0:4D:00:43:40:BD, a full weigh-in from first contact to the settled frame)
 * and cross-checked field by field against the independent implementation in
 * https://github.com/ronnnnnnnnnnnnn/etekcity_esf551_ble (MIT), whose
 * `esf551/protocol.py` gates on exactly the same signature bytes.
 *
 * Reading the capture alone would have got the weight wrong: bytes [10-11]
 * settle at 0x1b52, which divides by 100 into a plausible 69.94 kg. It is
 * really a 24-bit field, 0x011b52 = 72530 g = 72.53 kg, and byte [12] only
 * stops looking like padding once someone weighs more than 65.5 kg.

/**
 * Etekcity ESF-551 Smart Fitness Scale.

 * FFF0 service with FFF1 notify and FFF2 write, which is the same shape as the
 * Inlife and 1byone/Eufy families, and claiming that shape would take devices
 * away from them. It does advertise "Etekcity Smart Fitness Scale" in the clear
 * on every advertisement in the #385 capture, so the name is enough.
 *
 * The priority sits above Inlife (90) because Inlife's post-discovery rule is
 * "has FFF2 and not FFF4", which an ESF-551 satisfies: without this it is
 * claimed by Inlife, whose handshake it ignores, and the session ends on the
 * read timeout with no reading (#385).
 *
 * The scale streams settling frames continuously, several per second, with
 * byte [19] clear. Only the settled frame is a reading. There is no handshake:
 * subscribing to FFF1 is enough, which is why no `onConnected` is needed.
