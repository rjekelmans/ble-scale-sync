/**
 * Manual adapter override (`ble.force_scale_adapter`).
 *
 * Auto-detection reads an advertisement and, for a fleet of rebadged OEM
 * hardware sharing one vendor service, it can pick the wrong protocol adapter.
 * Every such report (#235, #318, #319) ends the same way: the user waits for a
 * release to fix a matcher, with no way to say "I know what this scale is".
 * This is that escape hatch.
 *
 * Scope is deliberately narrow. The override replaces the whole registry with
 * one adapter that claims every device it is shown, so it is only sound when
 * the transport already knows which device it is talking to. `ble.scale_mac` is
 * therefore required alongside it (enforced by the config schema): without a
 * target MAC, "matches everything" would mean connecting to the first phone or
 * television in range. `npm run scan` keeps the untouched registry, so device
 * discovery still reports what auto-detection would have chosen.
