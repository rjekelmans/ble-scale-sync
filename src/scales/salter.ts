/**
 * Adapter for Salter Bluetooth body-analyser scales (SALTER-SA00656-BK and the
 * SA00432 firmware family it reports in its Device Information Service; the
 * vendor string is "Healthcare ELectronic", a Nordic nRF5x design).
 *
 * This scale never speaks first. It answers a GATT connection, advertises three
 * notify characteristics, then sends nothing at all — through a weigh-in,
 * through a two-minute wait, through anything — until the client writes to FFC1.
 * It also puts no weight in its advertisement. Neither passive broadcast parsing
 * nor waiting for a stream works here; the only way to read it is to ask:
 *
 *   -> 0b 00        <- 0b 00                  keepalive
 *   -> 02           <- 02 <clock u32 LE>      the scale's own clock
 *   -> 08 00        <- 08 00 00               slot 0 count: empty, skip it
 *   -> 08 01        <- 08 01 02               slot 1 count: two records queued
 *   -> 09 01 01     <- 01 01 <ts> <record>    its newest position, count - 1
 *   -> 09 01 00     <- 01 00 <ts> <record>    then its oldest, position 0
 *   -> 08 02        <- 08 02 01               slot 2 count: one record, so
 *   -> 09 02 00     <- 02 00 <ts> <record>    one fetch, its only position
 *
 * IT ALSO STORES NOTHING UNTIL ITS CLOCK IS SET, which is why the one write this
 * adapter makes that CHANGES anything on the device is `01 <unix u32 LE>`, and
 * only when it finds the clock unset. Everything else it sends is a read.
 * Changing the batteries restarts that clock at zero, and in that state the unit
 * commits no measurements whatsoever: fourteen slot sweeps either side of a real
 * 88.5 kg weigh-in came back empty, every `08 <i>` counter reading 0, on a scale
 * that was otherwise answering every command. Writing the clock fixed it
 * outright, the next weigh-in committing immediately and reading back at age
 * zero with its composition intact. Without that write the adapter reads empty
 * slots forever on healthy hardware, which is indistinguishable from a scale
 * that is not talking at all, and a battery change is enough to cause it.
 *
 * A clock that is already set is LEFT ALONE; see {@link MIN_PLAUSIBLE_CLOCK_SEC}.
 * The vendor app writes local time into that UTC field and the scale drifts
 * about 24 s an hour, so its clock disagrees with the host by an hour or more,
 * and re-syncing would move the time base its own history is dated against.
 * Nothing here needs the two clocks to agree: every record is judged against the
 * scale's own clock, which cancels both the offset and the drift. QN (`0x20`)
 * and MGB both re-sync on every session; this one is deliberately narrower.
 *
 * MEASUREMENTS ARE STORED, AND WHICH SLOT HOLDS WHAT IS NOT PREDICTABLE. The
 * scale keeps every weigh-in; `08 <i>` counts how many a slot holds, and each
 * slot is a queue addressed by position: `09 <i> <n>` returns the record at
 * position n. A vendor-app trace read a slot holding two weigh-ins, and the
 * records' own timestamps settle which end is which: `09 01 00` returned 88.6 kg
 * stamped 1787692247 and `09 01 01` returned 89.2 kg stamped 1787692809, so
 * position 0 is the OLDER record, by 562 s, and count - 1 the newest. Reads are
 * non-destructive and nothing is ever cleared, so a slot's queue only grows
 * until the vendor app drains it.
 *
 * THE WALK FETCHES BOTH ENDS OF A BACKLOGGED SLOT. Reading only `09 <i> 00`, as
 * this adapter once did, is what hid a fresh weigh-in behind an old one: on a
 * live run against a backlogged slot, position 0 handed back the same 90.0 kg
 * record on every sweep, 168 070 s behind the scale's own clock, the age gate
 * rejected it each time, and nothing was published after the user had just
 * stepped off. Reading only `09 <i> <count-1>` would fix that on this unit, but
 * it rests on the ordering above holding on every firmware, and if a unit
 * queues the other way round the failure is the same one, silent. So a slot
 * with a count above one is asked for its newest position and then position 0,
 * and the newest-timestamp-wins comparison that already runs across slots picks
 * between them: whichever end the fresh weigh-in sits at, it is read. That
 * costs one extra round trip only on a backlogged slot. Newest is fetched
 * first because the scale can power off mid-sweep (see below), and the record
 * that matters should land before it does. Only the two ends are read: a
 * weigh-in that is neither the newest nor the oldest in its slot is never
 * fetched, which is the store-is-not-history stance below applied to a queue;
 * with a host connected each weigh-in gets its own session, so the case only
 * arises when the host was away for more than one. Checked on the same unit
 * against slots holding up to six records: on every sweep the newest position
 * published at 0 s of age while position 0 was rejected as stale.
 *
 * The store is not treated as history to be replayed. The older entries are past
 * readings already dealt with, some of them months old, and reporting them would
 * overwrite today's numbers with last month's. Records arrive in index order,
 * which is not chronological, so newest-wins is also what stops the reading that
 * resolves the session being whichever index happened to be read first.
 *
 * NEWEST IN THE STORE IS NOT THE SAME AS TAKEN JUST NOW, and on this hardware
 * the gap can be large. Position 0 of slot 1 held the OLDEST un-collected record
 * rather than the newest: a weigh-in taken with nothing connected pushed `08 01`
 * from 4 to 8 while `09 01 00` kept returning a record 334 seconds old, and one
 * session exported a record stamped 6720 seconds before the scale's own clock.
 * That is the failure {@link MAX_RECORD_AGE_SEC} exists to stop, and it is why
 * the age gate is not belt-and-braces here but load-bearing.
 *
 * NOTHING IS EVER CLEARED. The protocol has a clear (`0a <slot> <n>`, answered
 * `0a <slot> 00`) and the vendor app uses it, reading every position of a slot
 * and then clearing each, but this adapter does not, and that is deliberate.
 * The app's own history is whatever it drains, so a clear from here would also
 * erase weigh-ins the app has not yet seen. An earlier version fired the clear
 * on a timer without reading first; because the clear consumes an entry whether
 * or not anything read it, it destroyed unread weigh-ins off a real user's
 * scale. A later run of twenty clears against a counter of twenty, with one real
 * record present, left the store inconsistent for hours: the counter kept
 * climbing while records stopped being retrievable, until a battery pull reset
 * it.
 *
 * The cost of not clearing is that the store is never drained, so a backlog
 * persists until the vendor app collects it. The walk reads past a backlog by
 * fetching both ends of the slot, and the age gate keeps the old end from being
 * reported, so what a backlog costs is one extra round trip rather than a
 * reading. Whether one clear per connection, issued only after its record has
 * been decoded, would drain safely is untested on a healthy scale: the
 * observations above were made either side of a store this adapter's own
 * probing had corrupted, so they justify caution rather than a design.
 *
 * THE SCALE IS OFF MOST OF THE TIME. It powers up when someone stands on it and
 * powers down after the reading and a short standby, taking its radio with it. A
 * session open when it switches off gets no clean disconnect: the link dies
 * silently and writes stop completing, and on a transport that does not surface
 * the drop (macOS/noble was seen doing this) the session then only ends on the
 * idle timeout. Continuous mode with a short cooldown is the configuration that
 * suits it, and a short `ble.session_timeout_sec` (30 s or so) recovers from a
 * dead link quickly without cutting a live weigh-in short: the sweep answers
 * every few seconds, so a longer silence already means the scale has gone.
 *
 * BODY COMPOSITION IS DELIBERATELY NOT TAKEN FROM THE SCALE. The record carries
 * six derived values and they decode perfectly, but the scale computes them from
 * a user profile stored on the device, and that profile is whatever the vendor
 * app last wrote. On the unit this was decoded against the app had provisioned a
 * height of 100 cm, which the scale's own BMI field confirmed by reporting 85.7
 * for an 85.7 kg person — weight ÷ 1.00 m². Every derived value on that reading
 * inherited the error: 45 % body fat, 36.2 % water, 1078 kcal BMR, all displayed
 * by the app without question.
 *
 * Even provisioned correctly those values would describe whoever the scale was
 * last told about, not the user this reading is being matched to. So the adapter
 * reports weight only (`impedance: 0`) and body composition comes from the shared
 * estimator using the height, age and gender in the user's own config. That
 * follows the Hutbit adapter's precedent, where the vendor's derived body fat was
 * similarly unusable.
 *
 * The scale does measure bioimpedance — the display runs an electrode animation
 * with bare feet, and all six derived fields drop to zero in a socks-on reading
 * while the weight stays identical — but it exposes only the computed results,
 * never the raw ohms. There is nothing to feed the BIA estimator.
