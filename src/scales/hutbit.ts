 * notifications the phone replays a short FFB1 handshake, then the scale streams
 * `AC 02 [weight_u16_BE] 00 00 [STATUS] [CKSUM]` frames on FFB2, where
 * STATUS 0xCE = measuring/unstable and 0xCA = stable/final. Weight = u16 / 10 kg.
 *
 * Decoded from two known-weight HCI snoops (#254): `ac0203490000ca16`
 * = 0x0349 = 841 → 84.1 kg. The scale's own DERIVED body-fat frames are useless
 * (they reported 0.4 to 0.7 %), so this stays weight-only and body composition
 * comes from the shared BIA/BMI pipeline, same as the Robi S9 / Renpho adapters.
 *
 * That is not the same thing as the hardware having no usable sensor, and an
 * earlier version of this comment conflated the two. On a Juniper-branded unit
 * in the same family, holding the link open past the stable frame yields
 * `AC 02 FD 01 <impedance_u16_BE> CB <cksum>`, a raw impedance that passes this
 * file's own checksum and moves with the person rather than sitting fixed
 * (518 ohm at 103 kg, 539 and 619 ohm at 58 kg across two sessions). That frame
 * is decoded here (#322) and feeds the normal BIA path.
 *
 * The scale that is measured is not the scale that computes: the vendor's own
 * derived body-fat frames stay ignored, because a raw impedance and a wrong
 * body-fat estimate are separate questions and only the first is settled.
