/**
 * Decoder for the Bluetooth SIG Weight Measurement characteristic (0x2A9D) of
 * the Weight Scale Service (0x181D), and for the SIG Date Time field that both
 * this characteristic and Body Composition Measurement (0x2A9C) embed.
 *
 * The sibling `sig-bcs.ts` decodes 0x2A9C. It deliberately returns only
 * `timestampOffset` rather than a Date, so the Date Time decoder lives here,
 * with the first characteristic in the project that actually decodes it.
 *
 * Two other files walk a frame shaped like this one and are deliberately NOT
 * folded in:
 *
 * - `renpho.ts` subscribes 0x2A9D but uses 0.05 kg per unit, ten times the SIG
 *   resolution, confirmed against a physical scale. (`sig-bcs.ts` also keeps
 *   Renpho out of the 0x2A9C decoder, but for a different reason: it holds the
 *   first impedance across a split indication and ignores the fat.)
 * - `xiaomi-mi-scale-legacy.ts` decodes the same field layout at the same SIG
 *   resolutions, but from broadcast service data rather than a notification,
 *   and it reassigns flag bits the spec uses otherwise - bit 4 catty/jin and
 *   bit 5 stable, where the spec has User ID and BMI/height. Its agreement on
 *   the weight is a useful cross-check on this decoder, not a caller for it.
 *
 * Layout, per the SIG specification:
 *   Byte  0    : Flags (uint8) - bit 0 imperial, bit 1 timestamp present
 *   Bytes 1-2  : Weight (uint16 LE, 0.005 kg or 0.01 lb per unit)
 *   Bytes 3-9  : Date Time, when flags bit 1 is set
 */

/** Flags bit 0: set means pounds, clear means kilograms. */

/**
 * Decode a 7-byte SIG Date Time at `offset`.
 *
 * Every field is range-checked against the specification rather than handed to
 * `Date`, because `Date` does not reject the out-of-range values, it ROLLS
 * them, and each roll produces a plausible-looking timestamp that is wrong:
 *
 * - month 0 ("unknown" in the spec) becomes December of the previous year;
 * - day 0 becomes the last day of the previous month;
 * - a two-digit year, which is how a scale with a byte-sized year field
 *   reports 2026, becomes 1926, because `Date` maps 0-99 onto 1900+n.
 *
 * The last one is not cosmetic. `beurer-bf720.ts` treats any timestamp older
 * than a few minutes as a stored history record rather than a live weigh-in,
 * so a rolled-back date silently converts the reading somebody is standing on
 * into an old one.
 *
 * A field the spec cannot express is therefore no timestamp at all, which the
 * callers already handle: it is the same outcome as the flag being clear.
