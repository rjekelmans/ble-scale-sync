 * older build looks accepted and does nothing. #318 is exactly that shape, and
 * the reporter had no way to tell an ignored option from a broken one.
 *
 * This walks the raw parsed YAML before validation and names every key that
 * will be dropped. It only warns: erroring would brick a downgrade, and Home
 * Assistant add-on users share one config file across versions.
