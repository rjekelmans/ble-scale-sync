/**
 * Watch the parent directory of `configPath` for changes to its basename and
 * invoke `onChange` after a 500 ms trailing-edge debounce. Watching the parent
 * (not the file itself) survives atomic writes (tmp+rename) which replace the
 * inode, plus editor save patterns (vim `:w`, VS Code) that trigger 2+ events
 * within ~50 ms.
 *
 * Events that leave the file's content unchanged are ignored: FSEvents on macOS
 * replays directory history from just before the watch started, so the file's
 * own creation would otherwise arrive as an edit.
 *
 * Self-writes from updateLastKnownWeight() are suppressed via the suppress
 * window in write.ts, so this never re-fires for our own bumps. Errors from
 * fs.watch (e.g. parent directory unmounted) are logged and the watcher
 * silently stops; the SIGHUP path remains a manual fallback.
