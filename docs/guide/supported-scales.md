# Supported Scales

**35 protocol adapters**, plus a Standard BT SIG catch-all for any spec-compliant scale. Most adapters cover several rebrands, so real coverage is wider than the count.

## Scale List

_Weight only_ means weight is reported normally but body composition is estimated from BMI. [Known Limitations](#known-limitations) says why, per scale. Most popular brands first.

| Brand / Models                                                        | Body composition | Notes                                                                                                  |

## Finding Your Scale

The [setup wizard](/guide/configuration#setup-wizard-recommended) includes interactive scale discovery. It scans for nearby BLE devices, identifies supported scales, and writes the config for you. To scan without the wizard:

```bash
# Docker
docker run --rm --network host --cap-add NET_ADMIN --cap-add NET_RAW \
  ghcr.io/kristianp26/ble-scale-sync:latest scan

# Standalone (npm install or npx)
ble-scale-sync scan

# Standalone (from a clone)
npm run scan
```

::: tip Set your scale's MAC address
We recommend setting `scale_mac` in `config.yaml`. It prevents the app from accidentally connecting to a neighbor's scale. The setup wizard does this automatically. If you skip it, the app falls back to auto-discovery by BLE advertisement name.

## Known Limitations

Everything below still works; these are the quirks worth knowing before you buy or debug.

### **Soehnle**, **Sanitas** SBF72/73, **Beurer** BF915

Create user slot 1 in the manufacturer's phone app first.

### **Standard GATT**

Select user 1 on the scale before measuring.

### **Senssun** Model B

Not supported yet (only Model A with service 0xFFF0).

### **Koogeek** S1

The measurement protocol is implemented and verified, but this hardware's GATT connect and service discovery are unreliable on BlueZ and on ESP32 NimBLE, and succeed only occasionally on macOS CoreBluetooth. That is a trait of the device rather than of the adapter. Retry, or use whichever transport works best for your unit.

### **Renpho** R-MSC04 (MorphoScan Nova)

Weight is read and verified. Body composition is estimated from BMI (Deurenberg formula) rather than measured impedance. The vendor handshake is documented but not yet implemented, and the scale also closes the link after its history sync, so a reconnect is needed before the live measurement arrives. Tracked in [#117](https://github.com/KristianP26/ble-scale-sync/issues/117).

### **Eufy** Smart Scale P2 / P2 Pro

Weight only. The bytes previously read as impedance are not a body resistance, so publishing them produced absurd body-composition figures ([#289](https://github.com/KristianP26/ble-scale-sync/issues/289)). Body composition is estimated from BMI (Deurenberg formula) instead. A raw FFF2 capture paired with the Eufy app's own body-fat figure would let the real field be decoded.

### **Xiaomi** Mi Smart Scale 2 (XMTZC04HM)

Weight only. The 0x181D advertisement carries no impedance, so body composition is estimated from BMI (Deurenberg formula).

### **Xiaomi** Body Composition Scale S400 (MJTZC01YM)

The scale broadcasts its measurement as an encrypted MiBeacon frame, so it needs the per-device `ble.bind_key` from the Mi cloud (extract it with the community Xiaomi-cloud-tokens-extractor after pairing the scale in the Mi Home app) and `ble.scale_mac`: the measurement frames omit the MAC the decryption nonce needs, and the MAC is otherwise only learned from the idle beacon. Register a user profile in Mi Home (the scale tags each reading with a profile slot) and keep the Mi Home app closed while weighing, or the phone takes the session and nothing is broadcast. Weigh barefoot: with socks the scale sends weight only and body composition is estimated from BMI (Deurenberg formula). The scale measures impedance at 50 kHz and 250 kHz and a heart rate; the 50 kHz value feeds the Xiaomi body-composition formulas shared with the Mi Scale 2 (the app's own dual-frequency model is proprietary, so expect small offsets, see [Body Composition](/body-composition)), the other two are logged only. It is a "sleepy" device that advertises only while someone stands on it, so run `scan` while you are on the scale.

### **Silvergear** Smart Scale 108

Weight only. The advertisement carries a second frame after each weigh-in whose field looks like a whole-body impedance (529 ohm for a 108.5 kg adult, 0 for an object), but one sample is not a decode, so body composition is estimated from BMI (Deurenberg formula). The frame is logged in debug mode; a body-fat figure from the vendor app for the same weigh-in would settle it ([#297](https://github.com/KristianP26/ble-scale-sync/issues/297)).

### **Renpho ES-CS20M / Elis 1** (some hardware variants)

Some units use broadcast-only firmware that does not allow GATT connections. The same model name can ship with different internal hardware. If your ES-CS20M or Elis 1 is broadcast-only, ble-scale-sync reads weight directly from BLE advertisements. Body composition is estimated from BMI (Deurenberg formula) instead of impedance, since impedance is not available in broadcast mode. Run `ble-scale-sync diagnose` (`npm run diagnose` from a clone) to check whether your unit is connectable or broadcast-only.

## Don't See Your Scale?

If your scale uses BLE but isn't listed, it might still work. The **Standard BT SIG** adapter catches any scale that follows the official Bluetooth specification. Run the [setup wizard](/guide/configuration#setup-wizard-recommended) or `ble-scale-sync scan` to check.
