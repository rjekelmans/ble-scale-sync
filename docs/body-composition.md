# Body Composition

BLE Scale Sync calculates 10 body composition metrics from your scale's weight and impedance readings, combined with your user profile (height, age, gender).

**Impedance** is the electrical resistance measured when a small current passes through your body via the scale's electrodes (the metal pads you stand on). It's the key input for calculating body fat, muscle mass, water, and bone mass.

## Exported Metrics

| Metric              | Unit     | Description                                              |
| ------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Weight**          | kg / lbs | Raw scale reading (configurable via `weight_unit`)       |
| **BMI**             | (none)   | Body Mass Index                                          |
| **Body Fat**        | %        | BIA-based (requires impedance) or Deurenberg fallback    |

## How It Works

### Body fat (BIA)

When impedance is available, body fat is calculated using **Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis**:

```
LBM = c1 * (height² / impedance) + c2 * weight + c3 * age + c4
Body Fat % = (weight - LBM) / weight * 100
```

The coefficients vary by gender and athlete status:

|                  | c1    | c2    | c3     | c4   |
| ---------------- | ----- | ----- | ------ | ---- |
| Male             | 0.503 | 0.165 | -0.158 | 17.8 |
| Male (athlete)   | 0.637 | 0.205 | -0.180 | 12.5 |
| Female           | 0.490 | 0.150 | -0.130 | 11.5 |
| Female (athlete) | 0.550 | 0.180 | -0.150 | 8.5  |

### When an impedance is ignored

An impedance only drives the calculation when it looks like a body. Anything
below **150 ohm** or above **1200 ohm** is refused, and the reading falls back
to the Deurenberg estimate below.

The reason is that a wrong resistance is worse than none, and it fails
convincingly rather than obviously. A value far too high pins the 60 % ceiling.
A value far too low, which is what a missing or spurious factor of ten looks
like, drives `height² / impedance` up until lean body mass exceeds body weight,
and the result then pins the 4 % floor. Neither reads as an error; both silently
move every derived metric.

The raw impedance is still exported either way, so you can compare it against
whatever your vendor app reports. If your scale publishes an impedance and your
body fat still looks like a BMI estimate, that number is why, and it is worth
opening an issue with it.

### Body fat fallback (Deurenberg)

When impedance is not available (e.g. the scale only measures weight), only **weight**, **BMI**, and **body fat** (estimated) are calculated. The remaining metrics (water, bone, muscle, visceral fat, physique rating) require impedance and will not be available.

Body fat without impedance is estimated from BMI:

```
Body Fat % = 1.2 * BMI + 0.23 * age - 10.8 * sex - 5.4
```

Where `sex` = 1 for male, 0 for female. For athletes, the result is multiplied by 0.85.

### Other metrics

| Metric            | Formula                                                                      |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **BMI**           | `weight / height_m²`                                                         |
| **Water**         | `LBM * 0.73 / weight * 100` (athlete: 0.74)                                  |
| **Bone Mass**     | `LBM * 0.042`                                                                |
| **Muscle Mass**   | `LBM * 0.54` (athlete: 0.60)                                                 |
| **Visceral Fat**  | `Body Fat % * 0.55 - 4 + age * 0.08`                                         |
| **BMR**           | Mifflin-St Jeor: `10*W + 6.25*H - 5*A + s` where `s` = +5 male / -161 female |
| **Metabolic Age** | `age + (idealBMR - BMR) / 15`                                                |

## Athlete Mode

Setting `is_athlete: true` in a user's profile adjusts the formulas for people who exercise regularly. The [setup wizard](/guide/configuration#setup-wizard-recommended) asks about this during user profile creation.

Effects:

- **Lean Body Mass**: different BIA coefficients (see table above)
- **Water**: higher hydration factor (74% vs 73% of LBM)
- **Muscle Mass**: higher factor (60% vs 54% of LBM)
- **BMR**: +5% boost
- **Metabolic Age**: capped at actual age minus 5
- **Deurenberg**: result multiplied by 0.85

## Scale-Specific Algorithms

### Xiaomi Mi Scale 2 (MIBCS / MIBFS / XMTZC05HM)

The Mi Scale 2 broadcasts **raw impedance** in its BLE advertisement (service data UUID 0x181B). BLE Scale Sync reads the impedance and computes body composition using the Mi Scale algorithm: the same formulas used by the official Mi Fit / Zepp Life app, originally reverse-engineered by the [openScale](https://github.com/oliexdev/openScale) project. Results match what the scale's own display shows.

The adapter uses passive BLE advertisement decoding, so no pairing or GATT connection is required. This works on all transports including the ESPHome proxy.

If impedance is not present in a frame (e.g. the user stepped off before the BIA measurement completed), weight is still reported and body fat is estimated using the Deurenberg BMI fallback. All other body composition metrics require impedance.

### Xiaomi Body Composition Scale S400 (MJTZC01YM)

The S400 broadcasts weight plus its 50 kHz impedance (and a 250 kHz impedance and heart rate that are logged only). Body composition uses the same Xiaomi formulas as the Mi Scale 2 above. The S400's own app runs Yunmai's proprietary dual-frequency model, which no open implementation reproduces; on the same weigh-in the Xiaomi formulas land within about two points of body fat, 0.3 kg of bone mass and 2 kg of skeletal muscle of the app, while the generic BIA coefficients were more than five points of body fat away. Water and visceral fat differ by a few points either way. Expect small, consistent offsets from the app, not agreement to the decimal.

### Yunmai

The Yunmai scale computes body composition on-device and transmits the pre-calculated fat, water, muscle, and bone values in its BLE notifications. BLE Scale Sync uses those values directly; the remaining metrics (BMI, BMR, metabolic age, visceral fat, physique rating) are calculated locally.
