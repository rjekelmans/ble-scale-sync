/**
 * BlueZ applies a discovery filter to the scan it starts, so DuplicateData has
 * to be requested BEFORE StartDiscovery. Setting it afterwards, which is what
 * the broadcast path used to do, leaves the running scan deduplicating: BlueZ
 * keeps handing back the first advertisement it cached and a broadcast scale
 * reads as one frozen weight while the vendor app shows it counting up (#372).
 *
 * The second half of the same problem, and the reason these tests drive
 * `callMethod` rather than a stubbed `startDiscovery`: node-ble's own
 * `Adapter.startDiscovery()` sets a Transport-only filter of its own right
 * before StartDiscovery, and BlueZ REPLACES the filter dict rather than merging
 * into it, so calling ours and then node-ble's put the scan straight back to
 * deduplicating. A test that stubs `startDiscovery` cannot see that at all,
 * which is how it shipped (#397).
